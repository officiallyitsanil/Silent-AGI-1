# Silent AGI 1

Silent AGI 1 is a simulated AGI-like system built using a multi-agent architecture in Python. It demonstrates how multiple reasoning agents can collaborate to interpret and fulfill a complex natural language query — just like an Artificial General Intelligence system would do.

## 🧠 Features

- **Multi-Agent Reasoning**: Agents that perform language parsing, planning, and coordination.
- **Chain-of-Thought**: Simulates cognitive reasoning using sequential steps.
- **Tool Use**: Interfaces with mock APIs/tools (e.g., museum times, transportation, restaurants).
- **Scalable Design**: Modular system easily expandable to real APIs or domains.
- **Explainability**: Logs every step of decision-making.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies (pure Python)
